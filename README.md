# Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94  

This project analyzes traffic patterns on the I-94 interstate highway to identify key factors contributing to heavy traffic congestion. Using data from a highway monitoring station, the analysis explores how traffic volume varies with different conditions such as weather, time of day, and day of the week.  

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and handling of missing values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover traffic trends  
- Visualization of traffic volume changes under different conditions  
- Identification of key factors influencing heavy traffic  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains traffic volume records collected from a station on I-94. It includes information on weather conditions, time-related variables, and recorded traffic volume.  

## Usage  
The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step analysis of the dataset. Running the notebook will generate visualizations and insights into how different factors impact traffic congestion.  

## Results  
The project highlights major contributors to heavy traffic on I-94, providing insights that could be useful for traffic management and urban planning.  

## Contributing  
Contributions are welcome. If you have suggestions for improvements or additional analyses, feel free to submit a pull request.
